#  cookie.js â€“ simplifying JavaScript cookies
cookie.js is a tiny JavaScript library that simplifies cookies. It's capable of setting, getting and removing cookies, accepts a variety of parameters and supports chaining. cookie.js is released under the MIT/X11 license. It doesn't have any dependencies and if minified it's only ~1.4 KiB large.

This script will add an object called `cookie` to your global scope. 

## Why would you want to use it?
Working with cookies in JavaScript sucks. `document.cookie` is definitely one of the ugly parts of JavaScript. This library aims to simplify working with cookies and make them more fun to use.

## cookie.set()
You can use the `cookie.set` method to set cookies. The value will automatically escaped for you.

    cookie.set('key', 'value');

You can also set several values at once:

    cookie.set({
        key1: 'value1',
        key2: 'value2'
    });

If you need more options, like setting the expiry date, you can add an object with options as the 3rd parameter:

    cookie.set('key', 'value', {
        expires: 60 * 60 * 7, // expires in one week
    });

The following fields can be added to the options object:

 - `expires`: Either a number containing the seconds until the expiry, a
   date in the GMTString format or a date object. (e.g.: `60 * 60 * 24 * 7` for a week.)
 - `domain`: Allow other domains to access your cookie. (e.g.: `example.com`.)
 - `path`: Limit the access to the cookie to some path. (e.g.: `dir/`.)
 - `secure`: A boolean indicating whether the cookie shall only be accessable over a secure connection.

## cookie.get()
This method allows you to retrieve your cookies, you can use it by simply passing the key of the cookie:

    cookie.get('key');

Passing just one key like this will return a string, containing the value of the cookie. You can also pass an array of keys:

    cookie.get['key1', 'key2']);

This will always return an object. The keys of this object will be the keys you passed and the values are the corresponding values.

In case you want to add a default value you can use the second parameter. The default value will be returned if the cookie*(s)* could not be found:

    cookie.get('key', 'default value');

This also works with several keys:

    cookie.get(['key1', 'key2'], 'default value');

`cookie()` is a shortcut for `cookie.get()`. 

    cookie.get('key'); 
    // is the same as
    cookie('key');

## cookie.all()

To get all of the currently saved cookies simply use `cookie.all`. It will return an object containing all the current cookies.

## cookie.remove()

This method allows you to remove cookies. It accepts an infinite number of keys or an array of keys.

    cookie.remove('key');
    cookie.remove('key1', 'key2');
    cookie.remove(['key1', 'key2']);

## cookie.empty()

If you want to remove all cookies, this method is for you. Simply call `cookie.empty()` and all the cookies will be removed.

## Chaining

The methods `set`, `remove` and `empty` return the cookie object and therefore enable chaining. 

    cookie.empty().set('key', 'value').set('key2', 'value2').remove('key1');
