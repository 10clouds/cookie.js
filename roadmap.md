# Roadmap for cookie.js

Some things I plan to add to cookie.js:

- A new method that only sets a cookie if it doesn't exist yet and then returns the value of the cookie. I've already coded it, but I can't figure out a short and descriptive name for it. Any ideas?
- More unit tests.

I also plan to port this library to [node.js](nodejs.org). :)
