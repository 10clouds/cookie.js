# cookie.js–Unit Tests
**[✓] Currently all tests pass.**

cookie.js uses the [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha) testing framework and the [chai](http://chaijs.com) assertion library. You can run the tests by visiting the [test page](http://js-coder.github.com/cookie.js/tests/) or by cloning this repo and running the tests
locally. Keep in mind that you'll need a web server to run the tests, because cookies need a server.

*Currently there are no tests for the [`cookie.set`](https://github.com/js-coder/cookie.js#cookieset) options object.

If you want to add some tests, make sure to push to the *master* and the *gh-pages* branch.
