# cookie.js–QUnit Tests
**[✓] Currently all tests pass.**

cookie.js uses the awesome [QUnit](http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit) test suite for its Unit tests. You can run the tests by
visiting the [test page](http://js-coder.github.com/cookie.js/tests/) or by cloning this repo and running the tests 
locally.

*Currently there are no tests for the [`cookie.set`](https://github.com/js-coder/cookie.js#cookieset) options object. 
Furthermore the tests for [`cookie.all`](https://github.com/js-coder/cookie.js#cookieall) and
[`cookie.empty`](https://github.com/js-coder/cookie.js#cookieempty) are disabled on the test page. Right now these 
tests will just fail because GitHub adds some cookies for their statistic page.*

If you want to add some tests, make sure to push to the *master* and the *gh-pages* branch.
